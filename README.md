This project follows the Singleton design pattern and Layered architecture. This project that I have developed in java contains so many things from interfaces to implementation of classes in different layers, creation of DTO, DAO classes, DAOException class, usage of JDBC and Swing to make the GUI for presentation layer. Programming this project given me a ultimate knowledge that I was not known about and also I realized how robust programming language java is.
And after my Data layer I was giving very much time in typing the commands to compile the code so I have used gradle in this project after Data layer to compile the project faster.
