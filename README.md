This project follows the Singleton design pattern and Layered architecture. This project that I have developed in java contains so many things from interfaces to implementation of classes in different layers, creation of DTO, DAO classes, DAOException class, usage of JDBC and Swing to make the GUI for presentation layer. Programming this project given me a ultimate knowledge that I was not known about and also I realized how robust programming language java is.
I have used gradle also in this project to compile the project faster. Although I have written command line's also for that but still gradle made it easier for me.
